# PharmaCeylon API contract (pilot, v1)

Single reference for the web team. The machine-readable contract is the **OpenAPI document** served by the API.

## Base URL and prefix

- Local API default: `http://localhost:3001`
- All REST routes are under **`/api/v1`** (global prefix).

## OpenAPI / Swagger

- **Swagger UI**: `{API_ORIGIN}/api/v1/docs`  
  Example: `http://localhost:3001/api/v1/docs`
- Disable in a given process with `OPENAPI_ENABLED=false` (see `apps/api/.env.example`).

Controllers are annotated incrementally; sales routes include the richest operation docs. Regenerate or extend decorators on other modules as endpoints stabilize.

## Auth and branch context

- **`POST /api/v1/auth/login`**: JSON body `{ "email", "password" }` only. `AppUser.email` is **globally unique**; the server loads the user by email and derives `tenantId` from that row (subdomain-based routing can be added later without changing this contract).
- Browser flow uses **httpOnly cookies** and **CSRF** (`X-CSRF-Token` echoing the `pc_csrf` cookie). See existing web `auth-client` / API security modules.
- Branch scoping uses **`x-branch-id`** on requests that require a branch (same as today).

## Idempotency (money / stock mutations)

Send optional header **`Idempotency-Key`** (max 128 characters, trimmed). Keys are scoped per **`tenantId` + `userId` + operation scope** so two users do not collide.

| Operation | Scope (internal) | HTTP |
|-----------|------------------|------|
| POS checkout | `checkout` | `POST /api/v1/sales/checkout` |
| Goods receipt | `receive_goods` | `POST /api/v1/purchasing/purchase-orders/receive` |
| Transfer ship | `transfer_ship` | `POST /api/v1/transfers/:id/ship` |
| Transfer receive | `transfer_receive` | `POST /api/v1/transfers/:id/receive` |

**Semantics**

- First request with a key performs the mutation and records the key → resource id.
- Retries with the **same** key return the **same** resource (replay).
- Reusing a key for a **different** logical operation (e.g. different PO on receive, different transfer id on ship/receive) returns **400** with a clear message—do not silently post twice.

## Sales lifecycle (pilot)

- **Checkout**: `POST /api/v1/sales/checkout` — optional `Idempotency-Key`. Line **tax**: send `taxAmount` per line, or omit to apply **VAT** from server config (see below).
- **Void** (posted → voided, stock restored; elevated roles): `POST /api/v1/sales/:id/void`
- **Refund** (posted → refunded, stock restored): `POST /api/v1/sales/:id/refund`

**Controlled products** (`Product.isControlled`): checkout requires **pharmacist**, **manager**, or **owner** effective on the branch (owners may be recognized tenant-wide per service rules).

## Pricing / tax (Sri Lanka–oriented, configurable)

- **`PRICING_VAT_RATE_PERCENT`**: default `0`. When a checkout line omits `taxAmount`, VAT is computed as **exclusive** on `(unitPrice × qty − discountAmount)`, rounded half-up to 2 decimal places.
- Set to the statutory rate for your deployment when you want server-driven VAT without the client sending line tax.

## Versioning

Pilot uses **`/api/v1`**. Breaking changes should move to `/api/v2` or be gated by explicit API version headers if you outgrow this model.
