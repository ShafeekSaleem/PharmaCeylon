# PharmaCeylon API contract (pilot, v1)

Single reference for the web team. The machine-readable contract is the **OpenAPI document** served by the API.

## Base URL and prefix

- Local API default: `http://localhost:3001`
- All REST routes are under **`/api/v1`** (global prefix).

## OpenAPI / Swagger

- **Swagger UI**: `{API_ORIGIN}/api/v1/docs`  
  Example: `http://localhost:3001/api/v1/docs`
- Disable in a given process with `OPENAPI_ENABLED=false` (see `apps/api/.env.example`).

Controllers are annotated incrementally; sales routes include the richest operation docs. Regenerate or extend decorators on other modules as endpoints stabilize.

## Auth and branch context

- **`POST /api/v1/auth/login`**: JSON body `{ "email", "password" }` only. `AppUser.email` is **globally unique**; the server loads the user by email and derives `tenantId` from that row (subdomain-based routing can be added later without changing this contract).
- Browser flow uses **httpOnly cookies** and **CSRF** (`X-CSRF-Token` echoing the `pc_csrf` cookie). See existing web `auth-client` / API security modules.
- Branch scoping uses **`x-branch-id`** on requests that require a branch (same as today).

### Password recovery

Three `@Public()`, individually throttled endpoints. No branch header, no tenant context — the requester is signed out and `AppUser.email` is globally unique, so the emailed token is the only credential (same shape as staff invitations).

| Endpoint                                   | Throttle | Notes                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/request` | 5 / min  | Body `{ "email" }`. Always `200 { ok: true }`.                      |
| `GET /api/v1/auth/password-reset/:token`   | 20 / min | Pre-flight check. Returns `{ email (masked), expiresAt }` or `400`. |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/confirm` | 10 / min | Body `{ "token", "newPassword" }`.                                  |

**Semantics**

- **The request endpoint never reveals whether an account exists.** Unknown addresses and suspended accounts return the same `{ ok: true }` and send nothing. Clients must not word their UI in a way that reintroduces the leak.
- Tokens are stored as a **SHA-256 hash**; the raw value exists only in the email. Single-use, 30-minute TTL, and issuing a new one retires any outstanding tokens for that user.
- Confirm applies the tenant's `passwordMinLength` / `passwordRequireNumberOrSymbol` policy, clears `failedLoginAttempts` / `lockedUntil`, then **hard-revokes every session** (`tokenVersion` bump) — the user is signed out on all devices and must sign in again.
- Every failure mode (expired, spent, forged) returns one identical `400`.

## Idempotency (money / stock mutations)

Send optional header **`Idempotency-Key`** (max 128 characters, trimmed). Keys are scoped per **`tenantId` + `userId` + operation scope** so two users do not collide.

| Operation        | Scope (internal)   | HTTP                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| POS checkout     | `checkout`         | `POST /api/v1/sales/checkout`                     |
| Goods receipt    | `receive_goods`    | `POST /api/v1/purchasing/purchase-orders/receive` |
| Transfer ship    | `transfer_ship`    | `POST /api/v1/transfers/:id/ship`                 |
| Transfer receive | `transfer_receive` | `POST /api/v1/transfers/:id/receive`              |
| Product import   | `product_import`   | `POST /api/v1/products/import/confirm`            |

**Semantics**

- First request with a key performs the mutation and records the key → resource id.
- Retries with the **same** key return the **same** resource (replay).
- Reusing a key for a **different** logical operation (e.g. different PO on receive, different transfer id on ship/receive) returns **400** with a clear message—do not silently post twice.

## Sales lifecycle (pilot)

- **Checkout**: `POST /api/v1/sales/checkout` — optional `Idempotency-Key`. Line **tax**: send `taxAmount` per line, or omit to apply **VAT** from server config (see below).
- **Void** (posted → voided, stock restored; elevated roles): `POST /api/v1/sales/:id/void`
- **Refund** (posted → refunded, stock restored): `POST /api/v1/sales/:id/refund`

**Controlled products** (`Product.isControlled`): checkout requires **pharmacist**, **manager**, or **owner** effective on the branch (owners may be recognized tenant-wide per service rules).

## Approval thresholds (server-enforced)

Configured in Settings → Approval Rules and stored on `TenantSettings`. **The server decides — a request cannot opt out.** Purchase-order approval used to follow a client-supplied `submitForApproval` flag, which made the configured ceiling advisory; `common/approval-threshold.util.ts` is now the single place the comparison happens.

| Setting                                  | Applies to                            | Effect when tripped                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `approvalRequiredPurchaseOrderThreshold` | `POST /purchasing/purchase-orders`    | Created as `pending_approval` regardless of `submitForApproval`.  |
| `approvalRequiredReturnThreshold`        | Customer returns (create and submit)  | The owner/manager auto-approve shortcut is closed off.            |
| `approvalRequiredForBranchTransfers`     | `POST /transfers`                     | `false` skips approval entirely; `true` keeps the existing rule.  |

**Semantics**

- Document value is `(qty × unit − discount) + tax`, plus shipping for a PO — the same basis the order screen displays, so the threshold fires on the number the user saw.
- Comparison is `>=`: a threshold of `50000` catches an order of exactly 50,000. `null` means off; `0` legitimately means "approve everything".
- The rule is **role-blind**. Approval authority is already a separate permission (`purchasing.approve`, `returns.approve`, `transfers.approve`), so a held document is only clearable by someone who holds it — no second role carve-out is needed, and adding one would reopen the bypass.
- Return thresholds cover **customer** returns only, matching the setting's own wording; supplier returns follow the supplier workflow.
- `purchase_order.created` audit payloads carry `orderValue` and `approvalForcedByThreshold`, so a reviewer can tell a threshold trip from a voluntary submission.

## Pricing / tax (Sri Lanka–oriented, configurable)

- **`PRICING_VAT_RATE_PERCENT`**: default `0`. When a checkout line omits `taxAmount`, VAT is computed as **exclusive** on `(unitPrice × qty − discountAmount)`, rounded half-up to 2 decimal places.
- Set to the statutory rate for your deployment when you want server-driven VAT without the client sending line tax.

### Currency: LKR only

`Tenant.currency` accepts **`LKR` and nothing else**, validated with `@IsIn(SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES)` on both `PATCH /tenant/profile` and the onboarding draft. `common/currency.constants.ts` is the single list.

The app has no shared currency formatter — the rupee symbol is a literal across roughly forty screens, receipts and reports. Onboarding previously offered seven currencies, so a tenant could select AED and then be shown, and print, rupees everywhere. Restricting the input was chosen over shipping that mismatch.

**Widening the list is the last step of multi-currency support, not the first.** Add a `formatCurrency` driven by `Tenant.currency`, remove the hardcoded literals, then extend `SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES` and `CURRENCY_OPTIONS` in the web app. `COUNTRY_OPTIONS` keeps its full list throughout — timezone and phone code are honoured for real; only currency is pinned.

## Global search

- **`GET /api/v1/search?q=<term>&limit=5`** searches the active branch and tenant-scoped directories.
- Results are grouped by entity type and include deep-link metadata for products, invoices, customers, suppliers, purchase orders, transfers, and stocktakes.
- The API resolves the caller's effective branch permissions before querying each entity. A result from a domain the user cannot view is never fetched or returned.
- Exact identifiers/barcodes rank ahead of prefix and contains matches. `limit` applies per result group and is capped at 10.

## Notifications

All notification routes are authenticated and recipient-scoped. Branch-specific list/count calls honor `x-branch-id`; tenant-wide notices use a null branch and remain visible.

| HTTP        | Route                                | Purpose                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`       | `/api/v1/notifications`              | List active notices; supports `status`, `category`, `q`, `skip`, and `take` |
| `GET`       | `/api/v1/notifications/unread-count` | Lightweight unread badge count                                              |
| `PATCH`     | `/api/v1/notifications/:id/read`     | Mark one owned notice read                                                  |
| `PATCH`     | `/api/v1/notifications/read-all`     | Mark visible branch/global notices read                                     |
| `PATCH`     | `/api/v1/notifications/:id/archive`  | Archive one owned notice                                                    |
| `GET/PATCH` | `/api/v1/notifications/preferences`  | Read or update the caller's category preferences                            |

Operational alerts are durable, deduplicated projections. Header/page polling reconciles low-stock, expiry, purchase-order approval/overdue, transfer approval/receiving, and stocktake review/posting conditions at most once per user and branch every 20 seconds. When a condition clears, the notice is resolved instead of remaining as stale work.

Apply migration `20260829183000_add_notifications` before enabling these endpoints.

## Catalog work queue

Every catalog decision waiting on a person, in one durable list. Replaced the two screens whose
lists were recomputed on each request, which meant a dismissal could not be recorded.

| Route                                                               | Permission        | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /catalog-tasks`                                                | `products.view`   | Filters as comma-separated query params: `status`, `type`, plus `view` (`compliance`, `ambiguous`, `no_suggestion`, `safe`), `q`, `importId`, `source`, `createdFrom`, `createdTo`, `skip`, `take`. Unknown enum members are dropped rather than rejected, so a stale bookmark degrades to a broader list instead of a 400. Defaults to open work (`OPEN`, `NEEDS_REVIEW`). |
| `GET /catalog-tasks/summary`                                        | `products.view`   | Headline counts for the Manage-catalog badge and the Products issue banner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `POST /catalog-tasks/refresh`                                       | `products.manage` | Regenerates. Idempotent; never overwrites a `RESOLVED`, `DISMISSED`, or user-set `NOT_APPLICABLE` row. Optional `importId` scopes the pass to one import's products.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `POST /catalog-tasks/apply-safe`                                    | `products.manage` | Takes the same filter body as the list, so the number applied is exactly the number the button offered. Excludes anything compliance-sensitive or ambiguous regardless of evidence.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `POST /catalog-tasks/:id/apply`                                     | `products.manage` | Optional `categoryId` / `referenceProductId` override the suggestion. NMRA tasks apply through the same link service as the product page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `POST /catalog-tasks/:id/dismiss` \| `/not-applicable` \| `/reopen` | `products.manage` | Terminal states survive `refresh`; `reopen` is the manual override for a wrong exclusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Reference catalog and range

| Route                                  | Permission        | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /products/reference/preview-add` | `products.view`   | Dry run. Reports duplicate barcode/registration collisions and compliance differences per row.                                                                                                                      |
| `POST /products/reference/add`         | `products.manage` | Promotes NMRA reference rows into the range. Anything the preview flagged is **held back** unless `acknowledgeWarnings: true` — a client that forgets to show the review cannot silently create duplicate products. |
| `POST /products/range/exit`            | `products.manage` | "Stop selling". Per product the policy returns unrange (register-derived, no history), deactivate (locally created, or has history), or blocked (still holding stock), with a reason for each.                      |

`GET /products` additionally accepts `importId`, which scopes the list to one import run — this
is what the import completion screen's "View imported products" links to.

## Versioning

Pilot uses **`/api/v1`**. Breaking changes should move to `/api/v2` or be gated by explicit API version headers if you outgrow this model.
